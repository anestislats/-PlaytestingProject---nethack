# NetHackClone

This is a simple game I made back in the summer of 2016. It uses almost all of the programming concepts I learned throughout high school - 
Classes, OOP, polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, JApplet, 2D Arrays, loops, variables, and on and on. 

I have stopped working on it (for now); maybe I'll revive it using a more complex, game-based engine later. I have a Ideas.txt file for a couple features that I might implement later down the line. These are things like boss fights, spells, a shop to spend gold at, etc. 
Nonetheless, this was a passion project for me and represents my passion for programming and problem solving. I did not know what I wanted to do with my life at that point, but I had so much fun making this dinky little game that it finally soildfied that programming is something I want to do for a very long time. 

If anyone really wants to play it (or you can play the original game it was inspired by here: https://alt.org/nethack/), I can upload a .exe file that runs the game, just message me through GitHub. If you already have java installed it should only take a "javac *.java && java Runner" command from terminal to run this.

Here are two links to pictures of the gameplay:
